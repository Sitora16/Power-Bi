1. What is Power BI, and what are its three main components?
Power BI is a tool from Microsoft that helps turn raw data into clear, interactive visuals and reports. It’s designed so that businesses can quickly understand their numbers and make better decisions.
The three main parts are:

Power BI Desktop – where you actually build your reports on your computer.

Power BI Service – the online platform for sharing and working together on reports.

Power BI Mobile – the app that lets you check reports on your phone or tablet.

2. Name two business use cases for Power BI dashboards.

Checking how sales are doing for different products and months (like tracking laptops in the Sales_Data file).

Watching company finances, such as revenue and expenses, in one place.

3. How do you download and install Power BI Desktop?
It’s pretty simple:

Go to Microsoft’s official Power BI Desktop page.

Click Download free or find it in the Microsoft Store.

Run the setup file and follow the instructions.

4. What is the difference between Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service?

Power BI Desktop is where you design and create reports — it’s a Windows program and free to use.

Power BI Service is the cloud version — it’s for sharing and collaborating, and some features need a paid license.

5. What file extension does a Power BI project use?
Power BI Desktop files end with .pbix.

6. Explain the role of Power Query in Power BI.
Power Query is like a cleaning station for your data. Before making charts, you can use it to remove mistakes, change formats, and combine tables so everything looks neat in your reports.

7. Why would a business prefer Power BI over Excel for reporting?
Excel is great for calculations, but Power BI can make reports more interactive, handle bigger data without slowing down, and refresh information automatically from different sources.

8. Describe one limitation of the free version of Power BI.
You can’t share your online reports with others unless you upgrade to Power BI Pro.

9. What is a "published report" in Power BI Service?
It’s a report you make in Power BI Desktop and then upload to the online Power BI Service so others can view and work with it.

10. How does Power BI Mobile enhance accessibility?
With the mobile app, you can see and interact with your dashboards anywhere, even while traveling, and get alerts if something important changes.

11. Compare Power BI with Tableau—pros and cons.
Power BI is cheaper, easier for beginners, and connects well with Excel. The downside is that it’s not as flexible for very custom visuals.
Tableau is more advanced for complex visuals and very large data, but it’s more expensive and harder to learn.

12. Explain how Power BI integrates with Azure services.
It connects directly to tools like Azure SQL Database, Azure Data Lake, and Azure Machine Learning. This means you can use real-time data streams from Azure inside your Power BI reports.

13. What are "gateways" in Power BI, and when are they needed?
A gateway is like a secure bridge between your local (on-premises) data and Power BI Service. You need it if your data isn’t in the cloud but stored on your company’s servers.

14. How would you convince a company to adopt Power BI? (ROI argument)
I’d explain that Power BI can cut reporting time almost in half, give managers real-time insights for faster decisions, and let employees focus on analysis instead of manual work — which saves both time and money.

15. What security features does Power BI offer for sensitive data?
It uses role-based access so people only see what they should, encrypts data, and has row-level security to hide certain rows based on who’s looking.
